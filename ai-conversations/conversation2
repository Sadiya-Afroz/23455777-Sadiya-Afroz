me:How can my program understand natural language questions like “Will it rain tomorrow in Perth?
AI: To make your program understand a question like “Will it rain tomorrow in Perth?”, you need natural language understanding (NLU).

Extract intent → understand what the user wants (e.g., weather forecast).

Extract entities → find details like location (“Perth”) and time (“tomorrow”).

Convert those into structured data → for example:

intent: check_rain

city: Perth

date: 2025-10-23

Query the weather API (like wttr.in) with those details.

Interpret the result — if forecast mentions “rain”, answer “Yes, it will rain.”

You can do this easily with tools like spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, or simple keyword detection.


me: What’s a simple way to detect if the question is about temperature, rain, wind, or humidity?
AI: A simple way is to use keyword-based intent detection — quick and effective for weather apps.

Here’s how it works 👇

Define keyword groups:

Temperature → ["temperature", "hot", "cold", "warm", "cool"]

Rain → ["rain", "raining", "precipitation", "wet"]

Wind → ["wind", "breeze", "gust"]

Humidity → ["humidity", "moisture", "humid"]

Check which group matches the user’s question:

If the text contains a rain-related word → intent = "rain"

If it has a temperature-related word → intent = "temperature"

And so on.

Return the detected intent and handle it accordingly in your API logic.

💡 For better accuracy later, you can upgrade to NLP models (like spaCy text classification or transformer-based intent detection), but simple keyword matching is fast and works well for weather queries.
