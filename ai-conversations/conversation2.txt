Me: How can my program understand natural language questions like “Will it rain tomorrow in Perth?
AI: To make your program understand a question like “Will it rain tomorrow in Perth?”, you need natural language understanding (NLU).

Extract intent → understand what the user wants (e.g., weather forecast).

Extract entities → find details like location (“Perth”) and time (“tomorrow”).

Convert those into structured data → for example:

intent: check_rain

city: Perth

date: 2025-10-23

Query the weather API (like wttr.in) with those details.

Interpret the result — if forecast mentions “rain”, answer “Yes, it will rain.”

You can do this easily with tools like spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, or simple keyword detection.




Me: What’s a simple way to detect if the question is about temperature, rain, wind, or humidity?
AI: A simple way is to use keyword-based intent detection — quick and effective for weather apps.

Here’s how it works 👇

Define keyword groups:

Temperature → ["temperature", "hot", "cold", "warm", "cool"]

Rain → ["rain", "raining", "precipitation", "wet"]

Wind → ["wind", "breeze", "gust"]

Humidity → ["humidity", "moisture", "humid"]

Check which group matches the user’s question:

If the text contains a rain-related word → intent = "rain"

If it has a temperature-related word → intent = "temperature"

And so on.

Return the detected intent and handle it accordingly in your API logic.

💡 For better accuracy later, you can upgrade to NLP models (like spaCy text classification or transformer-based intent detection), but simple keyword matching is fast and works well for weather queries.



Me: What else we can do to parse users question? is there any llm solution for this?
AI: Totally—there are several solid ways to parse users’ questions, from classic NLP to LLM-first pipelines. Here’s a quick menu + a tiny blueprint you can copy.

# High-level options

1. Rules & classical NLP (fast, cheap)

* Regex, keyword maps, spaCy NER, dependency patterns
* Great for “known forms” (order status, booking IDs), weak on open-ended phrasing.

2. Intent + slots (production staple)

* A small classifier (or LLM) predicts intent; a slot/NER model (or LLM) extracts entities.
* Works well when you have ~10–200 intents and structured downstream actions.

3. Embeddings search (semantic routing)

* Vectorize the question, route to the best FAQ/doc/agent/tool.
* Combine with thresholds + fallbacks to reduce hallucinations.

4. LLM structured extraction (most flexible)

* Ask an LLM to return **strict JSON** for: intent, entities, dates, user goal, ambiguity flags.
* Add “tool/function calling” to trigger specific back-end actions.

5. RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)

* Pull relevant docs/KB chunks first, then ask the LLM to extract/answer using only those.
* Reduces hallucinations for knowledge queries.

6. Program-of-thought / multi-step parsing

* First pass: classify & identify missing info.
* Second pass: extract slots with strict schema.
* Optional third pass: confirm ambiguities with the user.

7. DSL or forms (when you need guarantees)

* Define a tiny domain language (e.g., `BOOK_HOTEL(city=..., date=...)`) and have the LLM output only that grammar; validate with a parser.

# What “LLM solution” looks like (minimal pattern)

Use a **structured output schema** and enforce it. Two passes is safer than one.

**Prompt (pass 1: route):**

> Task: Classify the user question into one of {“faq”, “task”, “chitchat”, “unknown”}.
> Also decide which tool (if any) should run from {“check_order”, “book_meeting”, “kb_search”, null}.
> Return JSON only: {"type": "...","tool": "...","confidence": 0–1,"missing_info": ["..."]}

**Prompt (pass 2: extract slots for a chosen tool):**

> Extract fields for `book_meeting`: {"attendee": str, "date": ISO8601?, "duration_min": int?, "topic": str?}.
> Return strict JSON, fill `null` if unknown, don’t invent.

# Guardrails that help

* **JSON schema validation** (reject/repair until valid)
* **Constrained decoding** (JSON-only, or a JSON grammar)
* **Test prompts with adversarial inputs** (“next Fri?”, “book with Sam”, multi-intent)
* **Confidence + “missing_info”** so your UI knows when to ask follow-ups
* **Telemetry & evals** (label 50–200 real queries; track intent F1, slot EM)

# Tiny code sketch (provider-agnostic pseudocode)

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional, List

class Route(BaseModel):
    type: str                 # "faq" | "task" | "chitchat" | "unknown"
    tool: Optional[str]       # "check_order" | "book_meeting" | "kb_search" | None
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0, le=1)
    missing_info: List[str] = []

class BookMeeting(BaseModel):
    attendee: Optional[str]
    date: Optional[str]       # ISO8601
    duration_min: Optional[int]
    topic: Optional[str]

def llm_structured(prompt: str, schema):
    # Call your LLM with "return JSON only" + a system guard.
    # Validate JSON against `schema`; if invalid, re-ask with “repair mode”.
    ...

user_q = "Book a 30min call with Rimi tomorrow morning about invoice issues."
route = llm_structured(PASS1_PROMPT + user_q, Route)

if route.tool == "book_meeting":
    fields = llm_structured(PASS2_BOOK_PROMPT + user_q, BookMeeting)
    if any(v is None for v in fields.model_dump().values()):
        # ask user for missing_info
        ...
    else:
        # call your calendar API
        ...
```

# Picking a stack quickly

* **Lightweight / fast:** rules + embeddings router
* **General app:** intent+slots via LLM structured JSON (+ RAG for knowledge)
* **Strict workflows:** LLM → DSL/grammar → parser → tools

If you tell me your domain (e.g., your POS, university portal, hospital/pharmacy SRS), I’ll sketch the exact intents, slot schema, and prompts—for free-ready copy-paste.




Me: Lets say we want to use ollama sdk of python for this. And we want a reponse in a json format having time_period, location, weather_attribute. What is the best approach for this? I need theory and psedocode of it.
AI: Great—using the Python Ollama SDK, the cleanest way to parse a user’s weather-style question into a strict JSON object is:

* **LLM-first structured extraction** (single pass), with:

  * **Constrained output** via Ollama’s `format="json"`.
  * A **crisp schema**: `{ time_period, location, weather_attribute }`.
  * **Guardrails**: JSON validation + a small “repair” loop.
  * **Light post-processing** for dates (“tomorrow”, “next week”) into ISO ranges.

Below is the theory + pseudocode you can copy.

---

# Theory (short & practical)

1. **Prompt shape**

* **System**: define the job (“extract only the 3 fields”), required JSON keys, allowed values for `weather_attribute`, formatting rules (ISO dates).
* **User**: the raw question + (optionally) the current date/time & default timezone so the model can resolve relative time (“tomorrow morning”).

2. **Constrained decoding**

* Ollama allows `format="json"` which forces a JSON object. This drastically reduces parsing hassle.

3. **Few-shot helps**

* Add 2–4 tiny examples (English + your common language) so the model learns how you want `time_period` normalized and what `weather_attribute` names look like.

4. **Validation + repair**

* Parse with a JSON schema (e.g., Pydantic). If invalid or missing fields, run a **repair prompt** that includes the invalid output and explicitly asks the model to fix it.

5. **Normalization rules**

* `time_period`: Prefer ISO-format:

  * Single point: `"2025-10-24"` or with a time range: `"2025-10-24T06:00/2025-10-24T12:00"`.
  * Ranges: `"2025-10-24/2025-10-27"`.
* `location`: Keep it as the user said (e.g., “Dhaka”), don’t geocode here unless you must.
* `weather_attribute`: pick from a closed set you support, e.g.
  `["temperature","precipitation","humidity","wind","uv","aqi","forecast","now"]`.

6. **Two-pass vs one-pass**

* **One-pass** is usually enough with `format="json"`.
* Add a **light second-pass** only if validation fails (repair mode).

## Notes & Tips

* **Model choice**: Start with a small instruct model that supports JSON well (e.g., `llama3.1:8b` or any local model you find accurate). If accuracy is shaky, step up to a stronger model on Ollama or add 1–2 more examples.
* **Ambiguity**: If the user asks multiple things, prefer the most specific attribute. If date is missing, default to `"forecast"` and today → next 3 days, or prompt the model (in the system text) to infer a reasonable short range.
* **Localization**: Keep a bilingual few-shot (English + Bangla) if your users mix languages. Your two examples above cover that pattern.
* **Strictness**: Because we pass `format="json"`, responses are usually already parseable. The **repair** step catches edge cases.
* **Downstream**: This parser is only for **understanding**. After you get `{time_period, location, weather_attribute}`, you can call your weather APIs/RAG layer.

If you want, tell me your *exact* attribute list and how you want “morning/evening/night” mapped to hours—I’ll plug that into the examples and give you a ready-to-run file.
