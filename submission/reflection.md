# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
`What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?`

I have used mostly chatgpt and ollam with gpt-oss:120b mdoel. They helped me two ways:

1. Chatgpt helped me clarifying concepts and confusion. Providing with pseudocode as needed.
2. ollama ( gpt-oss:120b ) helped me parsing users question or prompt.

Used ollama instead of hands-on-api.

## Prompting Techniques
`Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?`

I have used different prompting techniques as required while working on the project.
They are listed below:

1. Debugging prompts
2. Concept Exploration Prompts
3. and Implementation prompts

Output of these prompts helped me a lot in the process of development.


## What Worked Well?
`Describe one thing you’re proud of.`

Implemented several things according to the assignment requiremnets. But the most interesting part was the retrieval of weather data and using it different times as needed.

## What Would You Do Differently?
`Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.`

I would definitely jump `ipywidgets` for inputs and interaction, replacing `pyinputplus`.

## Final Thoughts
`Any parting comments on your learning experience?`

Lots of learning were there in the full development time of the project. Learned about getting data, parsing data, and using ai for parsinng and generating human like reponse for better experience. It was a very fun project, with the learning - for me.
